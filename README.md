## Usage

Receipt keys can be generated by selecting the **New Key** page from the menu. Once you have a key you can purchase Denarii from [libertytreewatering.com](https://libertytreewatering.com/product/denarius/) and it will be transfered to your key by pasting the public key into the **Layaway Manager Public Key** field. Once you have a key that holds Denarii receipts you can transfer them to different keys by selecting the **Transfer** page from the menu and pasting the recipient pubkey and entering the amount of Denarii you wish to transfer. The receipt manager will generate QR codes for importing private keys and transfer requests that can be scanned by selecting **Scan** from the menu. To consolidate your receipts into a single receipt click the consolidate button under the corresponding public key. Once a receipt has reached 5000 Dearii you can redeem it for a coupon for 100% off a Solidus Water Pail Kit at [libertytreewatering.com](https://libertytreewatering.com/product/solidus/).
